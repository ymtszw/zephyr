## Development

- Globally install:
  - Elm compiler (0.19)
  - [elm-live](https://github.com/wking-io/elm-live)
  - [google-closure-compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler-npm)
- Run `make`
- Open <http://localhot:8000>

### Atomic Design: PatternLab

Zephyr now utilizes Atomic Design, and has its own PatternLab mini-app for development!

- Run `make lab`
- Open <http://localhost:8001>

## In Windows

With this project, I've explored capability of Elm development in Windows. In short, it IS capable, with the help of WSL.
